# To Do

- [ ] Figure out command identification
- [ ] Nail down models (probably P1)
- [ ] Sort through bot functionality -- Not the game, just how the bot itself should find commands and run
- [ ] Write parser for custom blackjack notation
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku/PythonAnywhere?
- [ ] Write reddit response template -- Use Jinja?
